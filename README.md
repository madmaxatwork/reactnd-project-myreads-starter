# MyReads Project
**Programming assignment for the [Udacity React Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019) program.**

This project lets a user search for book titles and store them on different shelves depending on what the user is currently reading, what the user has read and what the user would like to read.
Books are sorted into three categories: Currently Reading, Want to Read and Read. The dropdown next to the book opens up the context menu with all the options.
If the user wants to add a new book to the store the green button opens up a search view.
